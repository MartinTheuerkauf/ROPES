# ROPES
The ROPES approach aims to translate pollen data from single large lakes into regional vegetation compositions. This project provides the R-code for ROPES and example data from the first publication (Theuerkauf and Couwenberg 2018 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00014).
